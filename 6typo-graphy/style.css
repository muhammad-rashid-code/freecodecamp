/* Step 5
Create a body selector and give it a font-family set to Open Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.

Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS. */
body {
    font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif;
}

/* Step 6
The font is a bit small. Create an html selector and set the font to have a size of 16px */
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

/* Step 7
Wrap your h1 and p elements in a div element. Give that div a class attribute set to label */

/* Step 8
Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.

Create a .label selector and give it a border set to 2px solid black */
.label {
    border: 2px solid black;
    width: 270px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 0 7px;
}

/* Step 9
Good use of white space can bring focus to the important elements of your page, and help guide your user's eyes through your text.

Give your .label selector a width property set to 270px. */

/* Step 10
Give your .label selector a margin property set to 20px auto, and a padding property set to 0 7px. */

/* Step 11
If you inspect your .label element with your browser's developer tools, you may notice that it's actually 288 pixels wide instead of 270. This is because, by default, the browser includes the border and padding when determining an element's size.

To solve this, reset the box model by creating a * selector and giving it a box-sizing property of border-box */
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Step 12
Remember that the use of h1, h2, and similar tags determine the semantic structure of your HTML. However, you can adjust the CSS of these elements to control the visual flow and hierarchy.

Create an h1 rule and set the font-weight property to 800. This will make your h1 text bolder. */
h1 {
    /* font-weight: 800; */
    text-align: center;
    margin: -4px 0;
    letter-spacing: 0.15px;

}

/* Step 13
Give your h1 selector a text-align property of center */

/* Step 14
Fine-tune the placement of your h1 by giving it a top and bottom margin of -4px and a left and right margin of 0. */

/* Step 15
Create a p selector and remove all margins. */
p {
    margin: 0;
}

/* Step 16
Lines can help separate and group important content, especially when space is limited.

Create a div element below your h1 element, and give it a class attribute set to divider */

/* Step 17
Create a selector for your new .divider and set the border-bottom property to 1px solid #888989. Also give it a top and bottom margin of 2px. It should not have any left or right margin. */

.divider {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #888989;
    margin: 2px 0;
}

/* Step 18
The letter-spacing property can be used to adjust the space between each character of text in an element.

Give your h1 selector a letter-spacing property set to 0.15px to space them out a bit more. */

/* Step 19
Nutrition labels have a lot of bold text to draw attention to important information. Rather than targeting each element that needs to be bold, it is more efficient to use a class to apply the bold styling to every element.

Give your second p element a class attribute set to bold */

/* Step 20
Your new class does not have any styling yet. Create a .bold selector and give it a font-weight property set to 800 to make the text bold.

Go ahead and remove the font-weight property from your h1 selector as well. */

.bold {
    font-weight: 800;
}
/* Step 21
Give your h1 element a class attribute set to bold. This will make the text bold again */
