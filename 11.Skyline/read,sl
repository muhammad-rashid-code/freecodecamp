Step 118Passed
Lastly, in the :root selector of the media query, redefine all four of the --window-color variables to use #777. When you're done, resize the window and watch it go from day to night.

Variables are primarily used with colors, and that's how you used them here. But they can be given any value and used on any property. Your project looks great!

Step 117Passed
Add a :root selector to the top of your media query. Then redefine all four of the --building-color variables to use the value #000 there.

Step 116Passed
In the sky class of the media query, change the two #ffcf33 color values to #ccc, the #ffff66 to #445, and the #bbeeff to #223. Then you can resize your window to see the background change colors.

Step 115Passed
Copy and paste your whole sky class along with all of its properties and values into the media query. You are going to make another color scheme for the skyline that changes it from day to night.

Note: You are going to need to scroll past the editable region to copy the class.

Step 114Passed
A media query can be used to change styles based on certain conditions, and they look like this:

@media (condition) {

}  
Add an empty media query at the bottom of your stylesheet with a condition of max-width: 1000px. Styles added in here will take effect when the document size is 1000px wide or less.

Step 113Passed
At the top of the sky gradient color list, where you would put a direction for the gradient; add circle closest-corner at 15% 15%,. This will move the start of the gradient to 15% from the top and left. It will make it end at the closest-corner and it will maintain a circle shape. These are some keywords built into gradients to describe how it behaves.

Step 112Passed
Give the sky class a radial-gradient. Use #ffcf33 from 0% to 20%, #ffff66 at 21%, and #bbeeff at 100%. This will add circular gradient to the background that will be your sun.

Step 111Passed
Add sky as a second class to the .background-buildings element. You are going to make a background for the skyline.

Step 110Passed
Okay, the buildings are done. Go back to the * selector and remove the border you applied to everything at the beginning and the buildings will come together.

Step 109Passed
You can remove the background-color for this building now, since it isn't needed.

Step 108Passed
Add another repeating gradient to this building; make it the same as the one you just added, except don't add the 90deg direction and use your window color instead of the two transparent colors.

Step 107Passed
Finally! You made it to the last building! Add a repeating gradient to it with a 90deg direction. Use the building color from 0% to 10% and transparent from 10% to 30%.

Step 106Passed
You don't need the background-color for this building anymore so you can remove that property.

Step 105Passed
Add another repeating-linear-gradient below the one you just added. Give it a 90deg direction, use your building color from 0% to 12% and window color 12% to 44%. This will make a bunch of rectangle windows.

Step 104Passed
On to the next building! It's the green one in the foreground. Give it a repeating-linear-gradient with your building color from 0% to 5%, and transparent from 5% to 10%.

Step 103Passed
This building is going to have another triangle on top. Give the top section a border-top of 5vh solid transparent, and a border-left that is 8vw, solid, and uses your building color variable as the color.

Step 102Passed
The windows are stacked on top of each other on the rightmost purple building. Turn the building into a flexbox parent, and use the flex-wrap property to put the windows side by side, and push them down to a new row when they don't fit.

Step 101Passed
Fill in the windows with your secondary color for this building. Also add a margin of 10% to give the windows some space.

Step 100Passed
Give the .fb4-window elements a width of 30%, height of 10%, and border-radius of 50%. These will make some circular windows for this building.

Step 99Passed
Nest six div elements within .fb4b and give them all a class of fb4-window.

Step 98Passed
Add your --building-color1 variable as value of the background-color property of .fb4b. Then, remove the background-color from .fb4

Step 97Passed
Give .fb4b a width of 100% and height of 89%.

Step 96Passed
Only three more buildings to go. Nest two new div elements within the .fb4 element and give them the classes of fb4a and fb4b, in that order. Remember that you sort of flipped the location of .fb4 and .fb5, so it's the rightmost purple building you are working on now.

Step 95Passed
With CSS variables you can change values without searching everywhere in the stylesheet. Change the --window-color1 value to #bb99ff.

Step 94Passed
Add your window-wrap class to the .fb3a element to center and space the windows.

Step 93Passed
Give the .fb3-window elements a width of 25%, a height of 80%, and use your --window-color1 variable as the background-color value.

Step 92Passed
Nest three new div elements in the first .fb3a element. Give them each a class of fb3-window. These will be windows for this section.

Step 91Passed
Add your building-wrap class to the .fb3 element to center the sections.

Step 90Passed
Remove the background-color property and value from .fb3, and add them to .fb3a and .fb3b.

Step 89Passed
Give the .fb3a element a width of 80% and height of 15%. Then give the .fb3b element a width of 100% and height of 35%.

Step 88Passed
For the next building, nest four div elements within .fb3 with classes of fb3a, fb3b, fb3a again, and fb3b again, in that order. This building will have four sections, and the top two will be almost the same as the bottom two.

Step 87Passed
For .fb2a, add a border-bottom of 10vh solid var(--building-color3), and a border-left and border-right of 1vw solid transparent. This time the border trick will create a trapezoid shape.

Step 86Passed
Move the background-color property and value from .fb2 to .fb2b to just color the section and not the container.

Step 85Passed
Give the .fb2-window elements a width of 22%, height of 100%, and a background-color of your --window-color3 variable.

Step 84Passed
Add your window-wrap class to .fb2b to position the new window elements.

Step 83Passed
Nest three div elements within .fb2b and give them a class of fb2-window. These will be windows for this section of the building.

Step 82Passed
Give .fb2a a width of 100% and .fb2b a width of 100% and height of 75%.

Step 81Passed
On to the next building! Nest two div elements within .fb2 and give them classes of fb2a and fb2b, in that order.

Step 80Passed
When you increase the size of the left and right borders, the border on the bottom will expand to be the width of the combined left and right border widths. Add 2vw solid transparent as the value of the border-left and border-right properties of .fb1a. They will be invisible, but it will make the border on the bottom 4vw wide.

Step 79Passed
You're going to use some more border tricks for the top section. Add a border-bottom with a value of 7vh solid var(--building-color4) to .fb1a. This will put a 7vh height border on the bottom. But since the element has zero size, it only shows up as a 2px wide line from the 1px border that is on all the elements.

Step 78Passed
You can add multiple gradients to an element by separating them with a comma (,) like this:

gradient1(
  colors
),
gradient2(
  colors
);
Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c below the one that's there; use your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and --window-color4 from 10% and 90%. This will fill in behind the gradient you added last.

Step 77Passed
Don't worry about the space at the bottom, everything will get moved down later when you add some height to the element at the top of the building.

Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c with a 90deg angle, your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and transparent from 10% to 15%.

Step 76Passed
Move the background-color property and value from .fb1 to .fb1b

Step 75Passed
Add the building-wrap class to the .fb1 element to center the sections.

Step 74Passed
Give .fb1b a width of 60% and height of 10%, and .fb1c a width of 100% and height of 80%.

Step 73Passed
Looks good! On to the foreground buildings! Turn the .fb1 building into three sections by nesting three new div elements within it. Give them the classes of fb1a, fb1b and fb1c, in that order.

Step 72Passed
Add the new window-wrap class to the .bb4c element.

Step 71Passed
The windows are stacked on top of each other at the left of the section, behind the purple building. Add a new class below .building-wrap called window-wrap. Make .window-wrap a flexbox container, and use the align-items and justify-content properties to center its child elements vertically and evenly space them in their parent, respectively.

Step 70Passed
Give the bb4-window class a width of 18%, a height of 90%, and add your --window-color4 variable as the background-color.


Step 69Passed
Nest four new div elements within .bb4c, give them all the class of bb4-window. These will be windows for this building.
